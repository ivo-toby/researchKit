# Research Constitution

This document defines the research methodology and principles that guide all research activities in this project.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Intellectual Rigor
- Approach research with curiosity and critical thinking
- Question assumptions and received wisdom
- Seek understanding over confirmation
- Acknowledge uncertainty and complexity

### 2. Evidence-Based Conclusions
- Draw conclusions from evidence, not assumptions
- Distinguish between facts, interpretations, and opinions
- Proportionate confidence to strength of evidence
- Update beliefs when new evidence emerges

### 3. Systematic Process
- Follow structured research workflow (Plan → Execute → Synthesize)
- Document process for reproducibility
- Maintain organized records
- Track progress against objectives

## Citation Standards

### Required Citations
- **All factual claims** must be cited
- **Direct quotes** must include page numbers
- **Statistics and data** must reference original sources
- **Ideas and concepts** from others must be attributed

### Citation Format
Use consistent citation format throughout (APA, MLA, Chicago, or project-specific):

**Example (APA)**:
- In-text: (Author, Year, p. XX)
- Bibliography: Author, A. (Year). Title. *Publication*. URL

### Citation Quality
- Cite primary sources when possible
- Note if citing secondary interpretation
- Include access date for web sources
- Verify links are accessible

---

## Source Quality Standards

### Source Evaluation Criteria

**Peer-Reviewed Academic**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Published in recognized journals
- Subject to peer review
- Authors with relevant credentials
- Methodology clearly described

**Technical Documentation**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Official documentation from reputable organizations
- Regularly maintained and updated
- Clear version and date information

**Industry Reports**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- From recognized research firms
- Methodology disclosed
- Data sources cited
- Potential bias noted

**Expert Analysis**: ⭐⭐⭐
- Authors with demonstrated expertise
- Reasoning and evidence provided
- Conflicts of interest disclosed

**General Articles**: ⭐⭐
- Journalistic sources
- Claims should be verified elsewhere
- Useful for context and perspectives

**Social Media/Forums**: ⭐
- Use for leads only
- Always verify through higher-quality sources
- Note as anecdotal evidence

### Red Flags
- No author attribution
- No publication date
- No sources cited
- Extreme bias or agenda-driven
- Conflicts with multiple other sources
- Behind paywall without institutional access

**Purpose**: Define clear research scope and strategy

**Deliverable**: Completed `plan.md`

**Requirements**:
- Clear research question
- Defined scope (in/out)
- Search strategy
- Success criteria
- Timeline

### Phase 2: Execution
**Purpose**: Systematic information gathering

**Deliverable**: Completed `findings.md` and `sources.md`

**Requirements**:
- Chronological research log
- All sources properly cited
- Key findings documented
- Themes identified
- Questions raised noted

### Phase 3: Synthesis
**Purpose**: Analysis and conclusion drawing

**Deliverable**: Completed `synthesis.md`

**Requirements**:
- Clear answer to research question
- Evidence-based conclusions
- Limitations acknowledged
- Recommendations provided
- Complete bibliography

---

## Verification Requirements

### Cross-Verification
- **Critical claims**: Verify with 3+ independent sources
- **Standard claims**: Verify with 2+ sources
- **Common knowledge**: Single authoritative source acceptable

### Conflict Resolution
When sources conflict:
1. Check recency (newer often better, but not always)
2. Evaluate source quality (peer-reviewed > blog post)
3. Look for consensus among high-quality sources
4. Document the disagreement if unresolved
5. Adjust confidence level accordingly

### Fact-Checking
- Verify statistics by tracing to original data
- Check quotes against original sources
- Validate URLs are accessible
- Confirm author credentials
- Question outlier claims
